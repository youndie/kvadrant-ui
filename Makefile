#
# ONE VERSION OF THE CHECKS, WRITTEN DOWN ONCE: the `uses: youndie/docs-bootstrap@<ref>` line in
# .github/workflows/check.yaml. CI runs the checks at that ref because the runner resolves the line.
# This file reads the same line and fetches the same ref into .docs-bootstrap/, a directory that
# ignores itself, so `make check` here runs what CI runs - the same scripts, the same guard, the same
# flags. Renovate bumps the line, and the next `make check` fetches what CI already moved to.
#
# WHY THE SCRIPTS ARE NOT COPIED IN. A copied check runs, but at the version of the day it was copied,
# and a fix upstream never arrives: across one portfolio 18 copies of backlog_index.py were found in
# three versions, eleven of them without the guard that makes `--check` fail when the backlog has
# gone missing - a guard that existed upstream the whole time.
#
# WHY THE VERSION IS NOT ALSO WRITTEN HERE. A version pinned in the workflow and again in this file is
# two pins, and two pins drift: one is bumped, the other is found months later, and "green here, red
# there" comes back with nobody able to say which side is right. So this file holds none; if the
# workflow names two different refs, it refuses to choose.
#
# WHAT LIVES HERE is what is this repository's own: where the tree is, how the backlog is kept, and
# checks of its own under `gate`. How the documents are checked - including the guard that fails the
# gate when docs/ or the backlog is not there - is in check.mk at the pinned version, and changes
# arrive with a bump instead of with a re-copy.
#
# ONLY A GOAL THAT RUNS THE CHECKS LOADS THEM. A project adds targets of its own below this head - a
# chart, a stand, a release - and make reads every included file, fetching the ones that are
# missing, before it runs any goal at all. Included unconditionally, check.mk made each of those
# targets, `make` alone and even `make -n` read the pin and download it on a fresh clone, and fail
# offline. So it is included only when a goal asked for - on the command line, or the default goal
# when there is none - is in DOCS_BOOTSTRAP_GOALS or is one of check.mk's own `docs-` targets; every
# other goal runs without docs-bootstrap and without the network. A goal of the project's own that
# leads to the checks (`ci: check build`) is added to DOCS_BOOTSTRAP_GOALS, above the line that says
# nothing below is meant to be edited; one that is not added stops on a message naming that
# variable.
#
# OVERRIDES. `DOCS_BOOTSTRAP=<dir>` runs the checks from a directory instead of the pinned ref: a
# clone of docs-bootstrap you are changing, or - offline, or without GitHub Actions - a committed
# copy of its check.mk, scripts/ and .claude-plugin/. That last one is the copy route again, with its
# drift; it is the fallback, not the default.
